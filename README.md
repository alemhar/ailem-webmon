## Technical Details

### Permissions Required

The extension requires the following permissions:
- `activeTab`: Access to the current active tab
- `tabs`: Resolve the active tab and scope monitoring
- `storage`: Chrome storage API access
- `cookies`: Cookie monitoring capabilities
- `webRequest`: Network request interception
- `webNavigation`: Navigation event monitoring
- `scripting`: Content script injection
- `<all_urls>`: Access to all websites for comprehensive monitoring

### Architecture

- **Background Script** (`background.js`): Service worker that handles network monitoring and data storage
- **Content Script** (`content.js`): Injected into web pages to monitor console logs and storage changes
{{ ... }}
- Network requests: Last 1000 requests stored in memory
- Console logs: Last 500 logs per tab
- Cookie changes: Last 500 changes stored
- Storage changes: Last 500 changes stored

Data is automatically cleaned up to prevent memory issues.

### Backend Submission (Optional)

- Configure placeholders in `src/config.js`:
  - `BACKEND_ENDPOINT = 'https://example.com/api/logs'`
  - `BACKEND_BEARER_TOKEN = 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`
- In the popup/Open Window, enable "Submit to backend" and choose a retry interval (Off/20s/1m/5m).
- When Off, a new head event will attempt once (e.g., on page reload) to avoid spam. When On, attempts run periodically.
- Submission success/failure toasts appear while the UI is open.
- Payload structure: see `references/backend_payload_reference.md`.

### Test Page (for quick validation)

`test_page/` contains `index.html` and `script.js` that generate console, network (GET/POST/XHR, 404, CORS, network fail), storage, and cookie events.

- Open in Chrome (enable "Allow access to file URLs" for the extension) or serve via a local server.
- Open the extension popup or use Open Window; set submission toggle and retry, then interact with the page.


## Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All data is processed locally in your browser
- **No External Servers**: No data is sent to external servers
{{ ... }}
### No Data Appearing
- Make sure you're on a webpage (not chrome:// pages)
- Check that the extension has necessary permissions
- Try refreshing the page and the extension popup

### Console Logs Not Showing
- Ensure the popup/Open Window was opened on the target tab (tab-scoped)
- Page-world console hook is injected by `src/content.js`; try refreshing the page
- Check background service worker and content script consoles for errors
